  Wait what...? That’s right.  Cap’n Chicken is gonna do it.  Finally after several 
years of being contained in Farmer Billy’s chicken coup, Cap’n Chicken has worked up 
the guts to steal Billy’s plane.  Help Cap’n Chicken in his rebellious skydive to the 
Mountains of Freedom!  But beware, the journey to the Freedom Mountains is not an 
easy one... Watch out for predatory hawks and the occasional Alpha... Good luck and 
have an eggcelent dive! 

This project is a vertical scrolling shooting game that utilizes animated sprites, collision detection, and algorithmic motion behaviors.  The game revolves around a chicken who is skydiving and trying to fall as long as possible while battling villanous hawks with his eggs.
